# go-blog-rest-api
An attempt at making a blog rest api using Go.
The main focus of this is to allow me to learn more about using Go, as it has quickly become my favorite language to write. 
Secondly, it will allow me to justify putting one of those cool gopher stickers on my laptop and not feel like a poser. 

Phase 1: Simple api scaffolding with the ability to return all blog posts and individual blog posts
Phase 2: Add a create/delete feature to blog posts 
Phase 3: Connect to a DB, deleting dummy data 
Phase 4: Incorporate a frontend framework to make it look a little nicer.
